Bonjour (slt), je vais vous présenter mon parcours citoyen pour les 3 dernières années, particulièrement dans le club informatique.

J'ai choisi de présenter ce projet grâce à sont rapport avec mes passions (peut-être citer), et un potentiel travail, ainsi que le temps dédié à ce projet.

En quoi ce parcours permet d'éveiller ma conscience de futur citoyen ? // check

J'ai donc choisi de faire la partie suivante sur mon parcours citoyen en anglais

So, my environmental consciousness started really young, as I grew up in a family caring a lot about the environment. To begin with, in 6th grade, I did a presentation about food and other waste in the school canteen, and in 7th grade, I was elected as my class's eco-friendly representative, even though I wasn't able to do anything due to organization problems.

In 8th grade, I joined the school's computer club, animated(?) by Mr. De Rancourt, where there were a projecct to create games in scratch, an educative software. In that year, we visited Brassart school's game design division, where we learned more about job opportunities in game design. After our school's 2024 open doors(?), we started working on a new project.

The idea of this project was to re-create the school's neighboorhood (and coincidentally, mine), and the school itself, on software, and to make that reproduction ecological. After investigating the different possibilities to achieve this project, we settled on using Minecraft, a sandbox game, for this project. So, we started using Minecraft in the computer club, with the goal of familiarizing everybody in the club with the use of Minecraft, while I started searching ways to work together on the project and to augment the possibilities on the software, as I already had experience with Minecraft as a way to design digital worlds (UVEG peut-être). 

During the summer, I continued my research of technical solutions to the diverse problems we met, for example with the school's internet firewall, which was blocking outside connections with most protocols, which blocked our use of multiplayer Minecraft. After finding solutions to most of the technical problems, I started the technical preparation of the project. I first set up a Minecraft server on my personal physical server, hosted in my garage, then started installing the various patches needed for our projet, and modifying the minecraft server and client to adapt to our use of the game. At the start of the school year, and up until late december, we sat up the software on the school's computers and did research on how we would make the neighboorhood more eco-friendly. 

We researched isolation materials, how to consume less ressources and other things, and the started the project. We build the school, some of the neighboorhood, presented this in the school's open doors (?), and [insérer partie actuelle].
