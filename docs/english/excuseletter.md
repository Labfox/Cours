Dear red Doors,

I owe you both a sincere apology. I know I’ve hurt you by kicking you with my foot, and for that, I’m truly sorry. You didn’t deserved to be treated that way, especially considering how faithfully you’ve served your purpose.

It was not my intention to harm you. I appreciate the fact that you stood strong despite my actions, and I hope we can put this unfortunate event behind us.

Please know that I’ll do my best to avoid any further mistreatment.

Thank you for your understanding, and I promise to be more gentle in the future.
