This document is a drawing, possibly a caricature for a website or magazine.

The colors are mainly red, blue and white. We can see two politics with animal heads. 
The one on the left is an elephant, the one on the right is a donkey. They are standing behind a podium and they look angry. 
Each podium has a letter: D for the donkey and R for the elephant. 
I see guess these two animals represent the candidates of the two main political parties in the USA: the democrats and the republicans. 
In November 2024, American voters will choose their new president. This cartoon must be from an criticist about the American political system.

Donald Trump became the new forty-seventh Republican president of the United States of America from 6am to 11am French time in 2024 for his last term taking over Joe Biden who was the forty-sixth president.

We learnt that it is likely that abortion will be forbidden
all over the country. Donald Trump promised to give the middle
classes more money. Journalists said that a lot of his ideas
were contradictory. Some swing states used to vote for the 
democratic party rather than the Republican party.

In this song Pink is blaming the president for not helping people in need / for not providing the Homeless with a bed.

He didn't solve poverty.

Title: IDK

I suppose, the man is dreaming of becoming a rockstar or a movie star.

He also seems to be dreaming of becoming a successful athlete or even the president of the USA.

In a word, he is dreaming of becoming someone rich and famous / successful.

Santa's sack sags slightly

Sort of audio, Who, What, nb of speakers.

a street-interview, there are 5 speakers. The speakers idea:

* If the first man were president, he would reduce poverty and he would make every American work. He thinks spending money on wars is a waste.
* If the second man were elected president, he wouldn't want the job because he thinks he is too old.
* If the third man were president, he would do whatever he wants and he would make the day after the Super Bowl a holiday. He thinks football should be the nation's priority.
* If the first woman were president, she would stop global warming and she would make everyone recycle. She thinks the environment needs more attention.
* If the second woman were president, she would finance research to counter AIDS, cancer, and other diseases. She thinks medical progress is crucial.

* If the sixth speaker were president and if she had enough money, she would finance research to cure cancer and other diseases.
* If the fourth speaker were president, he would make the day after the Super Bowl a holiday and he would make football the nation's priority.
* If the fifth speaker were president, he would reduce pollution by stopping global warming.

1. I would recycle if I had more time.
2. If I were you, I'd work harder
3. If I were the teacher, I would give less homework.
4. I would buy a yacht if I won the lottery.
5. If I met Madonna, I'd ask her for her autograph

1. If i were rich, I'd buy a big house near the sea.
2. If i lived near the sea, I would walk on the beach every day
3. Also, if i had a lot of money, I'd give some to my family and I'd help people who are very poor.


I would strengthen gun control by making a certification necessary, add more forces to child protection programs, force the government to use ONLY open-source software, try to revoque DMCA some parts of the DMCA.

New Year's resolutions:

(examples)

- I will exercise more
- I will stop smoking

The cat's answer is ironic, because a New Year's resolution is a promise which a person makes to be a better person at the beginning of the New Year, but which most people give up / are unable to stick to for more than a few days. What about you ? Do you make resolutions for the New Year? Do you usually stick to them or not ? If yes, how long for ? 

Personally, I didn't make New Year Resolutions because I already knew I wouldn't stick to them and I prefer keeping my immediate future unknown, I prefer doing day-to-day resolutions.

I will, I want, I would like

make laws for gun-related crimes harsher,
and i would legalize popular drugs but force a heavy tax on them and a repelling packaging,
coupled with ads to make people aware of the problems caused by drugs. If someone still wants
to buy drugs after that, thats their choice
I would also completely remove DMCA and rewrite a new law with less intellectual property
rights, especially on trade secrets and shareable media, and expand fair use clauses.

My pet would probably the dog i already have.

Who would live with me in the White House. Nobody.

^^Final challenge:^^ Writing: You are a journalist in the early 20^th^ century for a famous
British newspaper. Write about women's fight for the right to vote.

The new chapter will be about the suffragettes, who fought for the voting rights for women.

The new chapter will be about the fight of British women for their right to vote during the
World War One (the first World War), because we can see three woman who are holding banners 
where it is written "vote for women". It will be about their protest to become equal to men.
The Suffragettes were British women who wanted to have the rights to vote at the beginning 
of the 20th century. They fought for their rights, because they were supposed to do what 
their husbands wanted during the Victorian Age. THe picture on the left is a photo from an 
article in a newspaper, whereas the picture on the right looks like the front cover of a 
novel or it must be the movies poster of the movie "Suffragette"
