The docuument is a film / movie postrer.

The title of the movie is Warm Bodies

There is a tagline which says : "He's still dead, but he's getting warmer"

The characters are a boy and a girl. The boy is wearing sneakers (us) and blue jeans.

They look emotionless.

We suppose the story is a love story between a human and a zombie, between there is a crowd of zombies at the bottom.

1) "I have difficulties with grammar" (Kenny)

Maybe, you can read over your paper to check if you made some mistakes<br />
You should read more books <br />
You can ask your French teacher for help. You're already a determined person, so you could solve the problem.

2) "I'm afraid of speaking in public" (Brenda)

You should try to speak out loud when you're alone. <br />
YOu should record yourself and then listen to improve 
on your speaking skills

3) "I understand most things but it's harder for me to make sentences" Joshua

You should ask AI to create exercises for you to 
practice

Personally, I'm more conviced by the first one, because it's more colorful and cheerful and it makes me smile, but she sounds a little desperate to win.

The second one looks a little plain and it doesn't really catch my attention, even if Julia looks friendly.

The last one catches my attention because there's a play one words which makes me want to smile.

Is noah convicing ?

I'm conviced this guy will at least be a little responsive.


He begins by saying students should vote for him because he's fnny. He shows us "embarrassing moments" when he's making bad jokes that are not really funny. His audience, a girl, doesn't laugh.

Then, he adds that he's a good leader, and we see him giving orders to his siblings, sitting on the couch and wearing his campagin suit. They don't obey.

He is presented as being able to be self-deprecating (_il fait preuve d'auto d√©rision_), he doesn't take himself too seriously.
