The docuument is a film / movie postrer.

The title of the movie is Warm Bodies

There is a tagline which says : "He's still dead, but he's getting warmer"

The characters are a boy and a girl. The boy is wearing sneakers (us) and blue jeans.

They look emotionless.

We suppose the story is a love story between a human and a zombie, between there is a crowd of zombies at the bottom.

1) "I have difficulties with grammar" (Kenny)

Maybe, you can read over your paper to check if you made some mistakes<br />
You should read more books <br />
You can ask your French teacher for help. You're already a determined person, so you could solve the problem.

2) "I'm afraid of speaking in public" (Brenda)

You should try to speak out loud when you're alone. <br />
YOu should record yourself and then listen to improve 
on your speaking skills

3) "I understand most things but it's harder for me to make sentences" Joshua

You should ask AI to create exercises for you to 
practice

Personally, I'm more conviced by the first one, because it's more colorful and cheerful and it makes me smile, but she sounds a little desperate to win.

The second one looks a little plain and it doesn't really catch my attention, even if Julia looks friendly.

The last one catches my attention because there's a play one words which makes me want to smile.

Is noah convicing ?

I'm conviced this guy will at least be a little responsive.


He begins by saying students should vote for him because he's fnny. He shows us "embarrassing moments" when he's making bad jokes that are not really funny. His audience, a girl, doesn't laugh.

Then, he adds that he's a good leader, and we see him giving orders to his siblings, sitting on the couch and wearing his campagin suit. They don't obey.

He is presented as being able to be self-deprecating (_il fait preuve d'auto dÃ©rision_), he doesn't take himself too seriously.

a. You need to be eloquent, honest, altruistic, collborative, a good leader, kind, punctiual, persuasive, determined, empathetic, anti-bullying, respectful, convicing, positivity, sociable, activist, flexible, humility and easy-going

kamala harris was in favor of gun control

donal trump was against abortion

Mr.Anonymous

I would make laws for gun-related crimes harsher, I would make drugs on schedule II or lower legal to
consume, given a psychological exam for schedule II (and, obviously, forbidden for kids under 21). 
I would also create a tax on schedule II and III drugs. I would redirect these funds to education and 
prevention on drugs. I would also make laws for gun-caused crimes and felonies harsher. 
I would also try to remove DMCA to replace it with a law with less intellectual property rights on 
trade secrets and with expanded fair use clauses.

I liked the show, even tho I think sometimes it was a little too much. 
I also thought the english was too adapted for French ppl.

On the whole, most of us enjoyed the show.
First, we agree that the show was interesting and the actors played really well, considering
they had to play many parts.
Secondly, we found the story of Nelson Mandela inspiring, because he became a leader, after
spending 27 years in jail.
Yet, some of us thought the stage was plain and furthermore the weak point was that one of 
the actors didn't speak loud enough, whereas the actor who played the other lawyer really 
embodied real Mandela

"I learned hat courage was not the absence of fear, but the triumph over it."

"If people can learn to hate they can be taught to love, for love comes more naturally to the human heart than it's opposite."

"Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world."

"I either win or lean, but I never lose."

"The best weapon is to sit down and talk"

"It always seems impossible until it's done"
