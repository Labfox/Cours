About 2: I think it was pretty funny because in fact he really didnt really got hurt, the guards obviously let the attack go and Trump really overplayed (the famous self-growing band-aid).


During the Olympic games Leon Marchand, a french swimmer, won three gold medals and one bronze medal.

**Neuralink Set to Implant Second Human Patient**

??? abstract "Details"

	Neuralink, Elon Musk's brain-implant company, aims to give humans "cybernetic superpowers" and allow them to control robots with their thoughts, according to the billionaire. Musk recently announced that a second human patient is expected to receive an implant within a week.

	Key Things:

	- [x] Musk envisions future users of Neuralink‚Äôs brain-computer interface controlling prosthetics faster than before they lost their limbs.
	- [x] He predicts that Neuralink could treat epilepsy, cure paralysis, and even allow users to control Tesla's humanoid robot, Optimus, with their minds. The robot could be sold as early as next year.
	- [x] Neuralink plans to address technical issues experienced with the first patient, including implant detachment. Improvements like deeper wire insertion and reducing air pockets in the skull are in progress.
	- [x] Musk's optimistic timelines should be viewed with caution, as experts suggest Neuralink's technology is still experimental, with approvals limited to clinical trials.

	Musk also teased a more advanced version of the implant, doubling the number of brain-inserted wires and improving bandwidth. Despite the ambitious vision, commercialization for medical or other uses is still years away.

This is a tatoo about the 9/11 events. We see the two towers on the tatoo.


This document is a _. In the background, there's the American flag (called the Stars-spangled banner), there's a man, presumably a firefighter because he's holding a helmet under his left arm. The picture must have been taken in the USA shortly after the twin tower terrorist attack which took place on the September 9th 2001, widely called 9/11 attacjs? The fireman has got a tatoo all over his back which represents the plane and the twin towers in the middle and names on the left. The names must be those of firemen who died in the attacks of 9/11 victims. It must be the names of the members of his fire teammates who died in the rescue of the 9/11 victims. In the bottom left, we can notice/note the hand and the flame of the statue of liberty.
The man must have got this tattoo to pay respect to the firman

Look and react. Say all you can about the differences and similarities between these three photos.

In 2001, there was the twin towers before the attacks. After, in 2011, there was two laser aimed at the sky to commemorate the attack. In 2021, A single skyscraper had been built.

The three photos show the New York skyline which is easily recognisable with all its tall skyscraper made of steel.

They were taken every ten years from 2001 to 2021, because twenty three years ago there was a terrorist attack which destroyed the Twin Towers (= The World Trade Center) killing thousands of people.

In 2001 there were two similar skyscrapesr, whereas in 2011 there was a neon light flashing up to the sky where the two towers were missing.

Nowadays, in 2021, there is one tall skyscraper which was built where the two towers were standing.

**Passive form: was / were + participe pass√© du verbe (was taken)**

1. September 11^th^ is the Patriot Day
2. Americans commemorate the 2001 terrorist attack
3. There is a minute of silence at 8:46 am because the atack took place at that time.
