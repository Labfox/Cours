Stacey vit aux États-Unis. Ses vacances sont agréables, elle a passé du temps chez elle avec ses parents et
aussi quelques temps avec sa grand-mère où elle à fait de l'équitation. Sa petite sœur Cylia à eu 16 ans cet été, donc
elle a eu une fête d'anniversaire pour ses 16 ans (car aux états-unis, c'est un grand événement d'avoir 16 ans), où ils ont fait beaucoup
de petits cupcakes, et mit le désordre dans la cuisine en les cuisinant). Elle a aussi passé du temps avec ses vieux
amis du lycée.

Tom went to Wyoming for his vacation, especially in the Rocky Mountains,
in august with his brother, the first weeks were great, they've camped, kayaked and climbed, 
they also biked in the mountain, but sadly they were storms every day the last week so they had to get home early, 
when he was back home, he was jetlagged, and he fell over his backpack, twisted his ankle and broke his arm. And it isn't funny.
