Bonjour (slt), je vais vous présenter mon parcours citoyen pour les 3 dernières années, particulièrement dans le club informatique.

J'ai choisi de présenter ce projet grâce à sont rapport avec mes passions (peut-être citer), et un potentiel travail, ainsi que le temps dédié à ce projet.

En quoi ce parcours permet d'éveiller ma conscience de futur citoyen ? // check

J'ai donc choisi de faire la partie suivante sur mon parcours citoyen en anglais

So, my environmental consciousness start**ed** really young, as I grew up in a family caring a lot about the environment. To begin with, in 6th grade, I did a presentation about food and other waste in the school canteen, and in 7th grade, I was elect**ed** as my class's eco-friendly representative, even though I wasn't able to do anything due to organization problems.

In 8th grade, I join**ed** the school's computer club, animat**ed**(?) by Mr. De Rancourt, where there was a project to create games in scratch, an **ed**ucational software. In that year, we visit**ed** Brassart school's game design division, where we learn**ed** more about job opportunities in game design. After our school's 2024 open days(?), we began working on a new project.

The idea of this project was to re-create the school's neighboorhood (which is coincidentally mine neighborhood), and the school itself, on software, and to make that reproduction ecological. After investigating the different possibilities to achieve this project, we settl**ed** on using Minecraft, a sandbox game, for this project. So, we start**ed** using Minecraft in the computer club, with the goal of familiarizing everybody with Minecraft, while I start**ed** searching ways to work together on the project and to increase the possibilities of the software, as I already had experience with Minecraft as a way to design digital worlds (UVEG peut-être). 

During the summer, I continu**ed** my research of technical solutions to the diverse problems we met, for example with the school's internet firewall, which was blocking outside connections with most protocols, which block**ed** our use of multiplayer Minecraft. After finding solutions to most of the technical problems, I start**ed** the technical preparation of the project. I first set up a Minecraft server on my personal physical server, host**ed** in my garage, then start**ed** installing the various patches ne**ed****ed** for our projet, and modifying the minecraft server and client to adapt to our use of the game. At the start of the school year, and up until late december, we sat up the software on the school's computers and did research on how we would make the neighboorhood more eco-friendly. 

We research**ed** isolation materials, how to consume less ressources and other things, and the start**ed** the project. We build the school, some of the neighboorhood, present**ed** this in the school's open days (?), and [insérer partie actuelle].
