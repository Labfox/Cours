The docuument is a film / movie postrer.

The title of the movie is Warm Bodies

There is a tagline which says : "He's still dead, but he's getting warmer"

The characters are a boy and a girl. The boy is wearing sneakers (us) and blue jeans.

They look emotionless.

We suppose the story is a love story between a human and a zombie, between there is a crowd of zombies at the bottom.

1) "I have difficulties with grammar" (Kenny)

Maybe, you can read over your paper to check if you made some mistakes<br />
You should read more books <br />
You can ask your French teacher for help. You're already a determined person, so you could solve the problem.

2) "I'm afraid of speaking in public" (Brenda)

You should try to speak out loud when you're alone. <br />
YOu should record yourself and then listen to improve 
on your speaking skills

3) "I understand most things but it's harder for me to make sentences" Joshua

You should ask AI to create exercises for you to 
practice

Personally, I'm more conviced by the first one, because it's more colorful and cheerful and it makes me smile, but she sounds a little desperate to win.

The second one looks a little plain and it doesn't really catch my attention, even if Julia looks friendly.

The last one catches my attention because there's a play one words which makes me want to smile.

Is noah convicing ?

I'm conviced this guy will at least be a little responsive.


He begins by saying students should vote for him because he's fnny. He shows us "embarrassing moments" when he's making bad jokes that are not really funny. His audience, a girl, doesn't laugh.

Then, he adds that he's a good leader, and we see him giving orders to his siblings, sitting on the couch and wearing his campagin suit. They don't obey.

He is presented as being able to be self-deprecating (_il fait preuve d'auto dÃ©rision_), he doesn't take himself too seriously.

a. You need to be eloquent, honest, altruistic, collborative, a good leader, kind, punctiual, persuasive, determined, empathetic, anti-bullying, respectful, convicing, positivity, sociable, activist, flexible, humility and easy-going

Discours:

Dear fellow Americans,  
My name is Noah L. Sydow. I am 45 years old and I come from the beautiful state of Colorado, where the mountains stand
tall and the spirit of community is strong. I am proud to stand before you today as a candidate for a united, fair, and
prosperous future.

If you believe in the values of equality, kindness, and collaboration, I can promise you that together, we will work
tirelessly for positive change. My campaign focuses on two essential themes: **environmental sustainability** and *
*education reform**.

First of all, protecting our planet is not just a responsibilityâ€”it is our moral duty. I will promote renewable energy
initiatives, reduce pollution, and preserve the natural beauty of our states. If we act now, we will ensure that our
children and grandchildren inherit a cleaner, greener Earth. But if we neglect this responsibility, we risk losing
irreplaceable resources and jeopardizing our future.

Moreover, I believe that education is the foundation of a strong society. I will fight to provide better funding for
public schools, higher salaries for teachers, and affordable college tuition for every hardworking student. If every
child has access to quality education, we will create a generation of empowered, innovative, and responsible citizens.

To achieve these goals, I am committed to being a leader who is humble, reliable, and collaborative. I encourage you to
look at our shared values and join me in this mission for a brighter future. If you vote for me, I will dedicate every
resource, every moment, and every ounce of energy to making our vision a reality.

Together, we can build a tomorrow where opportunities flourish, where nature thrives, and where everyone feels valued
and respected.

Thank you, and may we continue moving forwardâ€”stronger together, united as one.

**Vote Noah L. Sydow. Vote for a better tomorrow.**
