This document is a drawing, possibly a caricature for a website or magazine.

The colors are mainly red, blue and white. We can see two politics with animal heads. 
The one on the left is an elephant, the one on the right is a donkey. They are standing behind a podium and they look angry. 
Each podium has a letter: D for the donkey and R for the elephant. 
I see guess these two animals represent the candidates of the two main political parties in the USA: the democrats and the republicans. 
In November 2024, American voters will choose their new president. This cartoon must be from an criticist about the American political system.

Donald Trump became the new forty-seventh Republican president of the United States of America from 6am to 11am French time in 2024 for his last term taking over Joe Biden who was the forty-sixth president.

We learnt that it is likely that abortion will be forbidden
all over the country. Donald Trump promised to give the middle
classes more money. Journalists said that a lot of his ideas
were contradictory. Some swing states used to vote for the 
democratic party rather than the Republican party.
