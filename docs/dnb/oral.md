Bonjour (slt), je vais vous présenter mon parcours avenir pour les 3 dernières années.

J'ai choisi de vous présenter mon parcours avenir en raison (du fait que j'y réfléchit sérieusement depuis longtemps).

Comment et en quoi mes expériences m'on-t-elles permis de préiser mes idées de travail ?

J'ai donc choisi de faire la partie suivante sur mon parcours avenir en anglais

My interest in IT started pretty young, as I was always interested by machines, and was amplified later when I got my first computer and started being interested in programming, around 8. My interest and skills then grew over the years, I had made my first website at 9, had a server at 11, and I now have multiple servers, websites, and programmation projets. 

During these years, I did multiple internships, one of which at my neighboor's company (which does IT management for (small and medium) companies), where I followed the company's boss during the interventions and created a custom website to allow a client to redirect his calls to specific employees depending on the caller. I also did an internship at Polytech where I learned more about the pos-bac possibilities and the contents of Polytech's formations, where we also talked about our computer club's project, which we were doing in partnership with Polytech.

In 8th grade, I joined the school's computer club, managed by Mr. De Rancourt, where there was a project to create games in scratch, an educational software. That year, we visited Brassart school's game design division, where we learned more about job opportunities in game design. After our school's 2024 open day, we began working on a new project.

The idea of this project was to re-create the school's neighboorhood (which is coincidentally mine neighborhood), and the school itself, on software, and make that reproduction ecological. After investigating the different possibilities to achieve this project, we settled on using Minecraft, a sandbox game, for this project. So, we started using Minecraft in the computer club, with the goal of familiarizing everybody with Minecraft, while I started searching ways to work together on the project and to increase the possibilities of the software, as I already had experience with Minecraft as a way to design digital worlds.

Indeed, I already had used Minecraft to create a world from scratch with friends, to help create a game we were designing, called *Une Vie en Guerre* which happenned in a fictionnal period of history beetween late Roman empire and early middle ages. We worked on this project on over 3 years, even tho we abandonned the project due to motivation issues. This allowed me to develop my skills in digital creation and time-sensitive coding.

During the summer, I continued my research of technical solutions to the diverse problems we met, for example with the school's internet firewall, which was blocking outside connections with most protocols, which blocked our use of multiplayer Minecraft. After finding solutions to most of the technical problems, I started the technical preparation of the project. I first set up a Minecraft server on my personal physical server, hosted in my garage, then started installing the various patches need for our projet, and modifying the minecraft server and client to adapt to our use of the game. At the start of the school year, and up until late december, we sat up the software on the school's computers and did research on how we would make the neighboorhood more eco-friendly. 

We researched isolation materials, how to consume less ressources and other things, and the started the project. We build the school, some of the neighboorhood, presented this in the school's open days.

This project made me discover the different challenges in managing a team, and made me dig deeper into entreprise systems and Minecraft's networking code, thus enhancing my coding capabilities. This projec also reinforced my will to work in I.T, and helped me specify more my work desires, as I now know I'd like to be an open source developper, and I'm already pursuing this by working on an open source operating system oriented towards new users.
